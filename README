The plugin adds two new commands:

:CPPaste
    to send the current buffer to http://codepad.org, open your pasted code
    in your webbrowser, and copy the URL of the pasted snippet to the
    clipboard.


:CPRun
    to send the current buffer to http://codepad.org, execute it on their server,
    and open both the pasted source and the program output in your browser.
    The URL of the pasted snippets is copied to the clipboard as well.


:CPPrivPaste
    to CPPaste privately.


:CPPrivPaste
    to CPRun privately.


The correct filetype is automatically detected through the 'filetype' option.
